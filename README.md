## 📖 Overview

**ContractClarity** is a production-oriented AI LegalTech platform designed to transform contract review into structured, law-grounded intelligence.

Built for both legal professionals and non-legal users, the system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with domain-specific legal databases to deliver:

- 🔍 Deep structural risk auditing  
- ⚠️ Quantitative contract risk scoring  
- 📚 Clause-level legal grounding  
- 🧠 Strategic negotiation modeling  
- ⚖️ Automated full-text contract revision  

Unlike generic LLM tools that provide surface-level explanations, ContractClarity performs multi-stage legal reasoning to identify unfair clauses, hidden liabilities, and asymmetric risk structures.

From a user perspective, the platform not only detects legal pitfalls but also generates actionable negotiation strategies. It provides structured, multi-style negotiation scripts — **assertive**, **compromising**, and **conciliatory** — tailored for both phone and written communication.

By combining legal retrieval, structured AI reasoning, and strategic modeling, ContractClarity empowers users to protect their interests and negotiate more favorable contractual terms.


## ❓ Why ContractClarity?

Traditional contract review is:

- Time-consuming and manually intensive
- Dependent on individual legal expertise
- Inaccessible for SMEs without legal counsel
- Vulnerable to oversight in high-volume reviews
- Not structured for measurable risk assessment

Generic LLM tools provide explanations but often:

- Lack legal grounding
- Hallucinate regulatory references
- Fail to produce structured outputs
- Cannot quantify contract risk

**ContractClarity bridges this gap** by combining domain-specific legal retrieval with structured AI reasoning and negotiation intelligence.

## 🧠 Engineering Highlights

### 🔹 Category-Based Vector Partitioning

Legal corpus is partitioned by contract category, reducing noise and improving retrieval precision.


### 🔹 Controlled Text Chunking Strategy

- Chunk size: 600
- Overlap: 60
- Designed to preserve legal clause integrity
- Prevent semantic fragmentation


### 🔹 Structured JSON Output Enforcement

The LLM is constrained to return structured JSON schema:

- overallRisk
- riskScore
- issues[]
- legalBasis
- mitigationAdvice

This ensures deterministic integration with the frontend.


### 🔹 Multi-Stage Reasoning Pipeline

1. Legal Retrieval (RAG)
2. Risk Identification
3. Strategic Negotiation Modeling
4. Contract Revision Drafting


### 🔹 Asynchronous Task Processing

Long-running analysis is executed via task-based architecture:

- `/analyze` creates task
- `/status/<task_id>` retrieves result
